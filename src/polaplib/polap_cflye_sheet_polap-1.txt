\section*{Figure description}

We used \texttt{Polap} to assemble plastid genomes by the subsampling-based approach without error-correcting low-quality Oxford Nanopore long-read data.
The maximum sampling rate in Stage 1 was 5\% with five replicates in Stages 2 and 3.
The index at Stage 1 is displayed at the bottom of an assembly graph figure, if any, next to the species name.
All of the figures were created using Bandage software (Wick et al. 2015).
