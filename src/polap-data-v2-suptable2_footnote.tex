Abbreviations are as follows: iteration (I), subsampling rate (Rate) and minimum read coverage (Alpha);
the peak memory usage (in gigabytes) by the `Flye` assembler during each iteration (Pmem),
the estimated genome size derived from short-read data, serving as an approximation of the plastid genome size (G), and
the processing time for each iteration (Time);
assembly metrics including the number of segments in the assembly (N), the total length of these segments (L), and
the number of circular genome paths detected (C);
the coverage ratio of the assembled sequences against the reference plastid genome (C_ref) and the target plastid genome (C_target);
the final plastid genome assembly length (Length), and the sequence similarity between the assembled plastid genome and the target plastid genome (Identity).
