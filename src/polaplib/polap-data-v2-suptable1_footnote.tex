Abbreviations for Stage 1 and 2 are as follows: 
iteration (I), subsampling rate (Rate) and read-coverage threshold (Alpha);
the peak memory usage (in gigabytes) by the `Flye` assembler during each iteration (Pmem),
the disjointig pre-assembly size (D),
the estimated assembly size derived from short-read data, serving as an approximation of the plastid genome size (G), and
the processing time for each iteration (Time);
assembly metrics including the number of segments in the assembly (N),
the total length of these segments (L), and
the number of circular genome paths detected (C); and
the final plastid genome assembly length (Length).
Abbreviations for Stage 3 are as follows: 
iteration (I), subsampling rate (Rate), short-read subsample size (Size);
random number seed (Seed);
the short-read polishing preparation time (Tp),
the memory required for short-read polishing preparation (Mp),
the short-read polishing time (Ts),
the memory required for short-read polishing (Ms),
the percent identity of a pairwise alignment with one from the previous step (Pident), and
the final plastid genome assembly length (Length).
The value of -1 in L and C represent no proper genome assembly.
The values of -1 in Length means no circular plastid genome assembled.
Because we have no previous assembly at the initial iteration of Stage 3,
the value of -1 is placed at Pident.
