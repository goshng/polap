\section*{Figure description}

We used \texttt{TIPPo} to assemble plastid genomes after error-correcting low-quality Oxford Nanopore long-read data.
Option \texttt{-p} is displayed at the bottom of an assembly graph figure, if any, next to the species name.
All of the figures were created using Bandage software (Wick et al. 2015).
