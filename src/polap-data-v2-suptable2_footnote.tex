Abbreviations are as follows: 
iteration (I), subsampling rate (Rate) and read-coverage threshold (Alpha);
the peak memory usage (in gigabytes) by the `Flye` assembler during each iteration (Pmem),
the estimated genome size derived from short-read data, serving as an approximation of the plastid genome size (G), and
the processing time for each iteration (Time);
assembly metrics including the number of segments in the assembly (N),
the total length of these segments (L), and
the number of circular genome paths detected (C); and
the final plastid genome assembly length (Length).
